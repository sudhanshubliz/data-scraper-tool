Automatically collect and process academic literature about:

CNT (Carbon Nanotubes) – materials with unique structural, electrical, and mechanical properties, often studied for energy storage, catalysis, and environmental applications.

CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage) – technologies aimed at capturing CO₂ emissions and reusing or storing them to mitigate climate change.
